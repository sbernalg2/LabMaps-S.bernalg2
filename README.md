This is the repository for the sixth laboratory and teaches the students how to use the ADT Maps, how to configure its two collisions management methods, and how to integrate it into the MVC scripts from the course.

This repository is part of the data structure and algorithms (#EDA) teaching framework at Universidad de los Andes. The repository was developed by faculty professors and staff in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineer (#DISC) and uses the Non-Object-Oriented Python library **DISCLib**.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a template repository to use in the laboratories in the data structures and algorithms (#EDA) course at Uniandes.

**IMPORTANT** This is a work in progress and is part of a teaching framework for undergraduate college students at Universidad de los Andes. This project Is NOT intended as a full-functional source code project.

<!-- STRUCTURE -->
### Structure

This laboratory repository has four main parts:

1. [DISClib](./DISClib) Root folder with the official course library. For more on its implementation visit the [DISClib Repository][disclib-url].
1. [App](./App) Folder with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Python scripts. In here the students implement their code to complete the laboratory instructions.
1. [Data](./Data) Folder with CSV data files to load into the application. In here the students add the data files provided by the course staff to complete the laboratory.
1. [Docs](./Docs) Folder with the report, data table and other documentation. In here the students add their project report, data tables and other files to complement their code implementation.
